# Testing Requirements

- Every feature page must have an associated Playwright end-to-end test.
- Tests should verify both isolated and combined feature pages.
- Tests should use real data from the public APIs, not mocks or stubs.
- Playwright should be the primary tool for E2E testing in this project.
