# Feature Test Pages

- Each Next.js 15 feature should have its own isolated test page under /src/app/feature-name or a similar structure.
- Where appropriate, features can also be combined on additional pages to demonstrate interoperability.
- Each feature page should use real data from public APIs (e.g., hp-api, jsonplaceholder, wttr.in) where possible.
- All feature pages must be covered by Playwright end-to-end tests.
