# Project Goal and Context

This project is a Next.js 15 demo and feature testbed, using the App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI components. It is designed to:
- Demonstrate and test every feature of Next.js 15 in isolation and in combination.
- Use public APIs (e.g., hp-api, jsonplaceholder, wttr.in) for data, not custom backend APIs.
- Provide a test page for each feature, with Playwright end-to-end tests for each.
- Serve as a boilerplate for evaluating hosting provider compatibility with Next.js features. 
- Dependencies are managed with npm.
