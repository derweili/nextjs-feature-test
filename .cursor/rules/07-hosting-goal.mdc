# Hosting Provider Evaluation

- This project will be used to test and compare various hosting providers for Next.js 15 compatibility.
- All features and tests should be designed to surface compatibility issues with different providers.
- Avoid provider-specific code or configuration unless testing that provider's features explicitly.
